Quant funds and digital asset desks share the same frustration: strategy research happens in disposable notebooks while real capital is deployed from a completely different stack. Every translation adds latency, fragility, and human risk. Tesser was born to collapse that gap by giving investors and developers a single programmable surface that runs from simulation to execution without rewriting a line of logic.

## The Opportunity We See

- **Latency parity between research and live trading.** By treating backtests, paper trading, and production engines as configurations of the same Rust core, Tesser keeps strategy behavior identical across environments. The same `Strategy` implementation that hits the simulator also drives live connectors.
- **Infrastructure reuse across venues.** We maintain battle-tested connectors for venues such as Bybit, Binance, dYdX, and Coinbase. Every improvement on one exchange compounds across the rest of the network.
- **Deterministic observability for operations.** Structured tracing, deterministic replay, and typed event busses turn "mystery fills" into debuggable data.

For investors, this translates into less operational drag, faster iteration cycles, and a real moat around IP. For engineers, it means the tooling finally matches the sophistication of their ideas.

## What Investors Should Know

1. **Modular revenue model.** Tesser is open source under MIT for individual builders, while enterprise desks pay for managed infrastructure, premium connectors, and 24/7 venue monitoring. Every module—`tesser-core`, `tesser-execution`, `tesser-portfolio`, and `tesser-rpc`—can be licensed individually or as a managed bundle.
2. **Aligned incentives.** Funds retain full custody of code and keys. We monetize the boring parts (infrastructure, compliance guardrails, exchange relationships) so teams stay focused on alpha.
3. **Regulated-ready architecture.** The messaging fabric enforces audit trails, deterministic replays, and read-only mirrors for risk teams. This keeps us compatible with future regulatory scrutiny without slowing down builders.

We already use the stack internally to underwrite exchange integrations and internal capital, which keeps our incentives aligned with our partners.

## Why Developers Choose Tesser

### 1. Native Rust Core

The core is written in safe Rust with `< 50µs` latency for order routing. Strategy authors can extend it with macros (`tesser-strategy-macros`) that remove boilerplate while keeping full control over memory and compute.

### 2. Batteries-Included Tooling

- **`tesser-cli`:** scaffolds projects, watches live markets, and deploys workloads to local clusters or colocation boxes.
- **Strategy SDK:** ships typed market data streams, technical indicators, and risk primitives in one crate so you can compose research code like Lego bricks.
- **Backtester + portfolio services:** deterministic engine that shares the same math library and persistence layer as production.

### 3. Connectivity & Automation

Exchange connectors, FIX/WebSocket clients, and risk daemons are all maintained in-tree. Operators can wire them together with YAML + TOML config, or talk to the platform over gRPC/JSON-RPC via `tesser-rpc`.

### 4. Observability by Default

Every module emits structured spans. You can stream them to ClickHouse, Kafka, or any OpenTelemetry sink. Replaying a live trading session for forensic analysis becomes a CLI call, not a week-long archaeology dig.

## Roadmap & How to Engage

Short term we are focused on:

1. **Cross-market portfolio nets.** Deterministic inventory netting across spot, perpetuals, and options.
2. **Deterministic execution sandboxes.** Replay live sessions with alternative parameters for controlled counterfactuals.
3. **Capital partner program.** Curated access for funds that want managed infrastructure but keep their strategy IP in-house.

Whether you're underwriting the next fund or building its tooling, we would love to talk. Start with the [docs](/docs), explore the repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/tesserspace/tesser), or reach out to the core team at `hello@tesser.space` to discuss dedicated support, custom integrations, or capital partnerships.

Let's build the operating system for programmable markets—together.
