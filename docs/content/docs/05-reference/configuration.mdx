## Files

- `config/default.toml` – Baseline values checked into git.
- `config/{env}.toml` – Environment overrides (e.g., `prod`, `staging`, `paper`).
- `.env` – Secrets and service endpoints, loaded automatically by the CLI.

## Key Sections

- `[execution]` – Selects the connector driver (`paper`, `bybit`, `binance`, …) and execution hints per strategy.
- `[risk]` – Max drawdown, per-asset notional caps, and participation throttles.
- `[data]` – Market data adapters, retention windows, and replay options.
- `[exchange.<name>]` – REST/WebSocket endpoints, credentials, plus arbitrary connector-specific parameters captured under a `driver` string. Everything under the table is forwarded to the connector factory, so you can add keys without editing core code.

### Connector Drivers and Parameters

Each `[exchange.<name>]` entry defines a logical profile. At minimum you provide the REST/WS URLs and a `driver` matching a registered connector factory. The remaining fields are passed through as a JSON object to the factory, so you can include custom keys without touching Rust.

For example, the built-in “paper sandbox” profile ships with:

```toml
[exchange.paper_sandbox]
driver = "paper"
rest_url = "sandbox"
ws_url = "sandbox"
balance_currency = "USDT"
initial_balance = 10000.0
slippage_bps = 0.0
fee_bps = 0.0

[exchange.paper_sandbox.market]
mode = "random_walk"
start_price = 25000.0
volatility = 0.003
interval_ms = 500
```

Because the paper connector understands `balance_currency`, `initial_balance`, and the nested `market` configuration, you can tune its behavior without changing code. Custom connectors follow the same pattern: expose whatever JSON fields you need, and deserialize them inside your `ConnectorFactory` implementation.

## Overrides

Use `--env` to select a profile at runtime:

```bash
tesser-cli --env prod live run --strategy-config strat.toml
```

All options can also be overridden with environment variables using the `TESSER__` prefix (e.g., `TESSER__RISK__MAX_DRAWDOWN=0.1`).
