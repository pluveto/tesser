description: Verify prerequisites and prepare your workstation for Tesser.

## Toolchain Requirements

- **Rust**: Install via [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs) and stick to the latest stable channel.
- **pnpm + Node.js 20**: Required for the standalone docs site and dashboard experiments.
- **Git**: Needed for pulling workspace updates and managing strategy repos.

```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -
```

## Workspace Bootstrap

Clone the repository and install the docs dependencies (they live in the `docs` folder and do not pollute the Rust workspace):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tesserspace/tesser.git
cd tesser
pnpm install --prefix docs
```

## Local Configuration

- Copy `config/default.toml` to a custom profile (e.g. `config/local.toml`) and adjust exchange keys.
- Export `TESSER_ENV=local` before running `tesser-cli` so it resolves the correct profile.
- Add `.env` values for services such as Prometheus exporters when you reach the operations stage.

Once these steps are complete you can jump back to the **Quick Start** page to execute your first backtest.
