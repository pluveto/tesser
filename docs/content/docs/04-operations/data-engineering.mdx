## Sources

- **Bybit Historical** – Use the public bulk download API or trigger `tesser-cli data download` with your API key for authenticated ranges.
- **Custom Feeds** – Drop CSV/JSONL files under `data/` and point backtests to them via `--data`.

## Validation

```bash
cargo run -p tesser-cli -- data validate \
    --input data/btcusdt_1m_sample.csv
```

The validator detects:

- Missing candles or duplicated timestamps.
- Price spikes outside configurable tolerances.
- Volume gaps that usually signal exchange outages.

## Storage

- CSV is the default interchange format.
- Parquet support is underway; the CLI already exposes `data convert --to parquet` so you can try it today for analytics workloads.

Keep raw downloads immutable and derive normalized datasets via scripts in `research/` so simulations remain reproducible.
