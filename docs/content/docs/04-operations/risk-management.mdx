## Pre-trade Checks

`tesser-execution` validates every order before it leaves the process:

- Max notionals per asset and per strategy.
- Leverage caps and maintenance margin checks.
- Participation throttles so you never exceed a configurable percentage of venue volume.

Orders that violate a rule are downgraded to warnings or rejected outright depending on the policy.

## Portfolio Guardrails

The portfolio service tracks exposure across venues. You can enforce:

- **Max Position** – Hard cap on base asset holdings.
- **Max Drawdown** – When equity drops below the configured percentage, Tesser downgrades to *liquidate-only*.
- **Circuit Breakers** – Tie into volatility indicators or exchange health to halt trading.

## Liquidate-only Mode

Triggered when drawdown or reconciliation fails. The system:

1. Cancels resting orders.
2. Flushes outstanding signals.
3. Only accepts exit signals until exposure returns to safe thresholds.

## Reconciliation

- Periodic account snapshots compare on-chain balances with local state.
- Any mismatch publishes a `ReconciliationEvent` so monitoring tools can alert operators.
- Optional “auto-heal” tasks flatten positions automatically for paper trading environments.
