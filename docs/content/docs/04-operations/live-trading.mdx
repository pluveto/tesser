## Checklist

- Configure API keys in `config/{env}.toml`.
- Set `execution.target = "bybit"` (or your custom connector).
- Point `data.market_stream` to the production WebSocket endpoint.

## Launch

```bash
cargo run -p tesser-cli -- \
    live run \
    --strategy-config strategies/sma_cross.toml \
    --env prod
```

The CLI spins up three async tasks:

1. **Market Data** – Streams ticks into the event bus.
2. **Strategy Runtime** – Executes your WASM-free Rust strategies with millisecond latency.
3. **Execution Engine** – Routes intent to the exchange and persists state for recovery.

If the process restarts it reloads everything from the SQLite snapshot and resumes from the latest offsets. Pair it with Prometheus exporters to watch latency, error rates, and per-strategy PnL in Grafana.
