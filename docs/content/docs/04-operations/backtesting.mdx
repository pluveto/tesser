title: Backtesting Engine
description: Replay months of data through the exact same event loop.
---

The backtester wires the data layer, strategies, and execution logic exactly like the live system—the only difference is the connector (`tesser-paper`) that simulates fills deterministically.

## Running a Scenario

```bash
cargo run -p tesser-cli -- \
    backtest run \
    --strategy-config examples/strategies/sma_cross.toml \
    --data examples/data/btcusdt_1m_sample.csv \
    --mode candle
```

Switch to `--mode tick` and provide order-book snapshots when you need depth-aware simulations.

## Reports

- Equity curve + drawdown
- Fill breakdown by hint (VWAP, Pegged, etc.)
- Latency histograms for strategy handlers

All reports serialize to JSON so you can feed them into your research notebook or CI.
